    <p>Hachiko the Akita was the shining example of why dogs are known as man's best friend.</p>
    <p class="section-text">
      <b>Hachiko, a golden brown Akita</b>, was born on November 10, 1923 at a farm located in Ōdate, Akita
      Prefecture,
      Japan. In 1924, Hidesaburō Ueno, a professor in the agriculture department at the Tokyo Imperial University,
      took Hachikō as a pet and brought him to live in Shibuya, Tokyo. Ueno would commute daily to work, and Hachikō
      would leave the house to greet him at the end of each day at the nearby Shibuya Station. The pair continued the
      daily routine until <i>May 21, 1925</i>, when Ueno did not return. The professor had suffered a cerebral
      hemorrhage,
      while he was giving a lecture, and died without ever returning to the train station in which Hachikō waited.

      Each day, for the next nine years, nine months and fifteen days, Hachikō awaited Ueno's return, appearing
      precisely when the train was due at the station.

      Hachikō attracted the attention of other commuters. Many of the people who frequented the Shibuya train station
      had seen Hachikō and Professor Ueno together each day. Initial reactions from the people, especially from those
      working at the station, were not necessarily friendly. However, after the first appearance of the article about
      him in Asahi Shimbun on October 4, 1932, people started to bring Hachikō treats and food to nourish him during
      his wait.
